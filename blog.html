		<h2>Firepit Construction</h2>

		<p class="blog-paragraph">Over the last few weeks, I decided to step away from the computer for a few hours and build something I have always wanted to build: a rustic fire pit. After watching various videos and researching different building methods, I opted to create an in-ground firepit with field stone held together by refractory mortar, which increases heat resistance and should provide additional protection for the stone.  Here is how I am building my fire pit:</p>

		<p class="bold-paragraph">DISCLAIMER: I am not a professional contractor.  This project was a home project that I created.  This guide is meant to explain how I built my own firepit and should not be used as an actual professional reference to build a firepit.  If you use this guide to build a firepit, you agree that you do so at your own risk.

				<strong>Materials Needed:</strong>
				<br />
				<ol>
					<li>Shovel</li>
					<li>Marking Spray</li>
					<li>Pea Pebbles</li>
					<li>Large Rocks</li>
					<li>Field Stone</li>
					<li>Cement</li>
					<li>Mortar</li>
					<li>Perlite</li>
					<li>String</li>
					<li>Straight Stick or Rod</li>
				</ol>

				<strong>Steps:</strong>
				<br />
				<ol>
					<li>Reseach town ordnance and local laws regarding the legality of building a firepit.  Certain municipalities prohibit fire pits.</li>
					<li>Find a location suitable for your fire pit.  It should be constructed away from flammable structures and vegetation, and there should be nothing of value in the ground at that location, such as utility lines or a septic tank (if the house has one).  Any overhanging tree branches should be removed.</li>
					<li>Plant the stick or rod into the ground, pointing vertically towards the sky, where the center of the fire pit will be.</li>
					<li>Tie string around marking spray can.  Measure out the radius of the fire pit on the string.  For instance, if the inner part of your fire pit is to be 36 inches in circumference, measure out 18 inches. Do not cut the string yet.</li>
					<li>Roll out another 12 inches of string.  Cut the string at that length.</li>
					<li>Tie string around the protruding stick at the appropriate length of your pit's radius.  (18 inches for a 36 inch inner pit)</li>
					<li>Walk around the stick, using marking spray to draw out a circle.</li>
					<li>Untie string from stick, and retie it, adding approximately 8 inches of string.  Repeat step 6.  There will be a second, outer circle now.</li>
					<li>Dig between the circles.  The result will be a large, dug out circle that resembles a moat.  It should be 6-8 inches deep and around 8 inches wide.</li>
					<li>Fill this dug out circle with cement, until cement mixture is level with the ground.  Let cement dry for at least 48 hours.  This will be the base upon which the stone will be layed.</li>
					<li>Once cement has dried, dig out the center of the pit.  The hole should be around 8-10 inches deep.</li>
					<li>In the center of the dug out pit, dig a smaller hole, approximately 10 inches in diameter and 12 inches deep.  This will be a drainage hole.</li>
					<li>Fill drainage hole with large stone.</li>
					<li>Fill fire pit with pea pebble.  Do not make it level with the ground or base.  There should be around 4 inches of space between base and pebbles.</li>
					<li>Create a 50/50 mix of cement and perlite.  This will act as refractory mortar.</li>
					<li>Spread a bit of mortar on the base, and put field stone down.  Make sure never to use river stone in the construction of this type of fire pit.</li>
					<li>Continue applying mortar and laying stone in a circular pattern around the base, leaving 2-3 inches of space between the stones every 2-3 feet.  The gap between the stone ensures proper oxygenation for the fire.</li>
					<li>Once first layer of stone has been layed, apply mortar and lay second layer, making sure to position the center of each stone over the gap of the two stones below.  This should aid in the firepit's structural integrity.  The 2-3 inch gaps mentioned in the previous step is not necessary.</li>
					<li>Continue to put down stone layers until desired height is achieved.  The top layer should be level.  This can be checked with a leveler.</li>
					<li>Line the inside of the firepit stone with a generous amount of refractory mortar to give a layer of heat protection</li>
					<li>Wait a week for the contruction materials to dry and set in.</li>
					<li>At first, build a small fire and every subsequent time, make the fire a bit bigger.</li>
					<li>Never build a fire that the firepit cannot contain, and always keep a fire extinguisher nearby.</li>
